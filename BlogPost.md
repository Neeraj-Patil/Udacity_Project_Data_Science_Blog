# Whoâ€™s Happiest at Work? Insights from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025


## Introduction

In this blog post I will be using the data from "Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025" to have a look at how job satisfaction varies with factors like job roles, place of employement and their correlations. Job satisfaction is a very key metric which can contribute to employee productivity and work culture. In this blog I have created some visualizations to try and understand the data from the developer survey.
The reason for this analysis is to infrom companies of certain roles and countires where developers are less satisfied with their work and help the companies to improve the work enviroment.


## Main questions to be answered: 

1. Which developer roles report the **highest and lowest job satisfaction**?  
2. Which countries have the **highest and lowest job satisfaction**?  
3. How does job satisfaction **vary across developer roles in the top 10 countries**?

## 1. Which Developer Roles Are Most Satisfied?

The analysis shows that **Founders in the technology sector** and **Senior Executives** report the highest average satisfaction (~8.3/10).  
Meanwhile, **Developer in the  AI apps sectors** and **Developer in game or graphics** report the lowest (~7.35/10).
