Job Satisfaction Analysis – Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025

This project explores job satisfaction among developers using the "Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025".  
The analysis focuses on how satisfaction levels differ across developer roles and across the top 10 countries with the most respondents.
The goal of this project is to find out:

-Which developer roles report the highest job satisfaction?

-How does job satisfaction vary across different countries?

-Are there regional differences in job satisfaction?

-Which roles are consistently satisfied across multiple countries?


Understanding developer satisfaction helps:  
- Improve workplace culture and retention  
- Identify roles with high and low satisfaction  
- Highlight regional differences  
- Inform management and HR decisions


Summary of Results

- **Highest satisfaction roles:** Founders, Product Managers (~8.55–8.23/10)  
- **Lowest satisfaction roles:** Applied Scientists, System Administrators (~7.42–7.43/10)  
- **Countries with highest satisfaction:** Brazil, Netherlands (~7.39–7.36/10)  
- **Regional satisfaction trend:** South America > North America > Asia > Europe  
- **Roles consistently satisfied across countries:** Academic Researchers  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- High-level or strategic roles report higher satisfaction.  
- Regional differences suggest cultural and workplace influences.  
- Certain roles maintain high satisfaction across countries, while others vary depending on location.
