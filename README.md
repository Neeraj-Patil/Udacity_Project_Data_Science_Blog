Job Satisfaction Analysis – Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025

This project explores job satisfaction among developers using the "Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025".  
The analysis focuses on how satisfaction levels differ across developer roles and across the top 10 countries with the most respondents.
The goal of this project is to find out:
-How satisfied are developers in different roles?
-How does job satisfaction vary across different countries?
-What is the satisfaction distribution by role across top 10 countries?

- Dataset: [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)  
- Key Question: *How does job satisfaction vary by role and by country?*  
- Satisfaction scores range from **0 (lowest)** to **10 (highest)**.  
- Tools used: **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook**
